The original **Simple-Factions** plugin was created by **Entropire**. This version has been updated and optimized by me for **Minecraft 1.21.11**.

## 📝 Description
Simple-Factions is a small factions plugin for Minecraft. With this plugin, you can create a faction and invite your friends to join. Once you have created a faction, it will be displayed in your name, tab list, and chat.

## ✨ Features

### Faction System
This system allows you to create, modify, and delete factions, as well as invite or kick players from your faction.

### Chat System
When you are in a faction, you can use the custom chat system. This allows you to communicate with other members of your faction without others seeing it.
